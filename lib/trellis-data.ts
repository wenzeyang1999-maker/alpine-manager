    summary: "Dual co-founder ownership (50/50 Mehta / Sharma). Strong VC pedigree. 7 FTEs — single operations professional functions as executive assistant, not back office.

YELLOW: absence of internal back office partially mitigated by fractional CFO (Summer 2026) and planned Head of Finance (2027).",
    findings: `### Management Company and Affiliates

Trellis Capital Management, LLC ("Trellis", the "Manager") is a pre-seed stage venture capital firm headquartered in San Francisco. Trellis was founded in 2018 by Arjun Mehta (Co-Founder, Managing Partner) and Priya Sharma (Co-Founder, Managing Partner). Prior to founding the firm, Arjun was a principal at Founder Collective, a Boston area seed-stage venture firm, while Priya was a partner at Foundation Capital, a venture firm based in Silicon Valley.

Trellis has deployed capital across four funds: Fund I (2018, $47 million, fully deployed), Fund II (2021, $78 million, fully deployed), Fund III (2024, $150 million, 64% deployed / reserved), and Fund IV (2026, ~$125 million initial close, pre-deployment).

### Assets under Management

Trellis reported net assets of $280.3 million as of December 31, 2025, plus $113.7 million in uncalled capital out of $274 million in total commitments to the firm's first three funds. The firm also manages several co-investment special purpose vehicles ("SPVs") with total assets of $24.7 million as of the same date.

### Insider Investment

GP commitments to Funds I-III were 1% of total commitments (~$2.8 million), contributed in cash and invested pari passu with LP commitments, free of management fees.

### Ownership & Succession

Arjun Mehta and Priya Sharma each own 50% of the firm (confirmed via Form ADV Schedules A & B). No formal succession plan exists, though the Managing Partners could assume each other's responsibilities in a key person event. The key person provision (per Fund IV's LPA) would only be automatically triggered if both Managing Partners fail to provide sufficient time and attention. Key person life insurance is not maintained.

### Human Resources

With a total headcount of seven full-time employees — six investment professionals and Sarah Collins (Head of Operations) — Trellis is a small organization with resultant limitations to segregation of duties. Sarah's responsibilities focus on running business operations and acting as an executive assistant for the Managing Partners, rather than serving as a back office resource for the funds. The investment team consists of Arjun Mehta and Priya Sharma (Co-Founders, Managing Partners), Kevin Chen (Principal, joined Q2 2025), Rachel Winters (Associate), Ryan Mitchell (Analyst), and Vikram Nair (Chief Product Officer, departure planned Summer 2026).

The firm has recently retained Raj Patel as fractional CFO (former CFO of Atomic, a Miami-based venture studio). Raj will focus on overseeing Apex, though he will not dedicate substantial time until Summer 2026. A full-time Head of Finance is planned for 2027. James Crawford, an independent attorney and former partner at Hartwell & Sterling, is retained on an ad hoc basis for deal-related legal matters.

### Staff Turnover

Regarding staff turnover: Omar Hassan (Associate) departed in August 2025 to pursue personal business endeavors, while Emily Brooks (Head of Operations) departed in December 2024 to move into an investment-focused role. Both departures were amicable. Sarah Collins was hired in July 2025 to replace Emily. Sanjay Gupta, a part-time venture partner, departed near end of 2024 to start his own venture firm.

Kevin Chen joined as a principal in Q2 2025. Vikram Nair, who began as a part-time venture partner in early 2024, was brought on full-time as Chief Product Officer but is planning to leave this summer to start his own company. A talent recruiter has been hired to identify replacement candidates.

### Background Checks

Employee background checks have been completed by the Managing Partners on an internal basis. The firm has not engaged a third-party background check provider, though a search for one is currently underway based on investor feedback. Staff are compensated with a base salary and discretionary bonus, and all investment staff participate in carried interest vesting over four years.

### YELLOW Rating Rationale

The YELLOW rating reflects two primary deficiencies: (1) the sole operations professional (Sarah Collins) functions as an executive assistant rather than a back office resource, leaving no internal oversight of the Administrator's accounting work; and (2) significant recent staff turnover relative to team size. These are partially mitigated by the planned engagement of fractional CFO Raj Patel (Summer 2026) who will focus on Apex oversight, and the targeted full-time Head of Finance hire in 2027.`,

    name: "Legal, Regulatory & Compliance", rating: "RED",
    summary: "RED: Investment professional (Priya Sharma, Co-Founder) holds compliance oversight — required action before close. No initial or annual compliance attestation from staff. No annual compliance training. No written personal trading policy. ERA-exempt from SEC registration. No disciplinary history.",
    findings: `### Regulatory Oversight

The firm is exempt from registration with the SEC under the venture capital adviser exemption and has filed as an Exempt Reporting Adviser ("ERA") since March 9, 2019. Although not subject to the same regulatory requirements imposed on registered advisers, ERAs are required to complete certain sections of the Form ADV, implement written MNPI policies, and are subject to anti-fraud and "pay-to-play" provisions.

### Compliance Infrastructure and Policies

Priya Sharma (Co-Founder, Managing Partner) is responsible for compliance oversight in addition to her investment responsibilities. Alpine is strongly opposed to an investment professional holding this responsibility and would prefer to see it reside with a non-investment professional such as Sarah Collins (Head of Operations). This is a required action before close.

Compliance consultant usage has been limited to engaging Summit Advisory for annual Form ADV preparation. A broader compliance consultant engagement would strengthen the firm's compliance program. The firm maintains a compliance binder with the required ERA policies (pay-to-play, insider trading, AML). However, there is no initial attestation or annual recertification of compliance policies required from staff, and no annual compliance training program has been implemented.

### Personal Trading

Although the firm has an insider trading policy, the firm does not have a written personal trading policy as this is not a requirement of SEC ERAs. While concerns in this area are limited considering the scope of the firm's investment activities, Alpine would prefer to see a baseline policy in place, in line with broader industry best practices.

### Trade Errors

Due to the nature of the firm's investment activities, trade errors are not anticipated.

### Soft Dollars

The firm does not utilize soft dollars.

### Expert Networks

The firm does not utilize expert networks.

### Anti-Money Laundering / Know Your Customer

The Manager represented that investor AML verifications are completed by Apex Fund Services.

### Claims, Actions, and Conflicts

The firm represented that neither the management company, its affiliates, nor any employees have been subject to any action, claim, investigation, or litigation in the past ten years. Professional liability insurance provides up to $1 million in coverage. The firm's Managing Partners serve on boards of portfolio companies, with any directors' fees waived.

### RED Rating Rationale

Red rating based on the cumulative weight of compliance deficiencies: (1) investment professional responsible for compliance oversight, (2) no compliance attestation or recertification process for staff, (3) no annual compliance training program implemented, and (4) limited compliance consultant engagement. While the firm's policies meet ERA minimum requirements, the overall compliance environment falls below institutional standards.`,

  3: {
    name: "Technology, Cybersecurity & Business Resilience", rating: "RED",
    summary: "RED: Substantially underdeveloped cybersecurity environment. No formal cybersecurity policy, incident response plan, or third-party framework (NIST/ISO). No penetration testing. No DLP on endpoints. No written BCP. Cybersecurity vendor search underway — targeted by end of 2026.",
    findings: `### IT Overview

There is no single individual in charge of IT and the firm has not appointed a technology or cybersecurity consultant. Sarah Collins (Head of Operations) is leading a search for a third-party cybersecurity vendor to conduct a formal audit, vulnerability test, and implement a training program by end of 2026. The firm relies on cloud-based applications with no onsite infrastructure beyond internet connection.

### Cybersecurity Controls

The firm has not created a formal cybersecurity policy or incident response plan. No third-party cybersecurity framework (e.g. NIST, ISO/IEC 27000) has been adopted. No employee cybersecurity awareness training or phishing campaign has been implemented. The firm has not implemented endpoint data loss prevention, and staff maintain access to removable media (USB), personal email, and personal cloud storage on company-issued endpoints. Penetration testing has not been completed.

Controls in place: baseline network security (firewall, anti-virus), user access controls on a need-to-know and least-privilege basis, password-protected accounts (though periodic password changes are not enforced), and MFA on key business applications.

### Business Continuity

The firm does not have a written business continuity plan. Staff maintain the ability to work remotely. The firm should prepare a BCP covering service provider contingency, staff protection during a crisis, and stakeholder communications.

### RED Rating Rationale

Red rating. The cybersecurity environment is underdeveloped across multiple dimensions: no formal cybersecurity policy, no employee awareness training, no incident response plan, no endpoint DLP, no penetration testing, and no written BCP. The planned cybersecurity vendor engagement is a positive step, but the Red rating stands until formal policies and testing are implemented.`,

    name: "Fund Structure, Terms & Investor Alignment", rating: "GREEN",
    summary: "GREEN: Delaware LP structure confirmed. Standard VC terms — 2.5%/1.5% management fee, 20% carry, American waterfall. No preferred return (market norm for VC). GP commits 1% pari passu. Key person provision, clawback, and recycling up to 120%. LPAC formation at GP discretion.",
    findings: `### Legal Structure

Trellis Capital IV, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership formed March 28, 2026, confirmed against the Delaware Division of Corporations register. Trellis Capital GP IV, LLC (Delaware LLC) serves as the Fund's general partner. Both entities confirmed.

### Key Terms

Interests are offered in US Dollars with a minimum commitment of $1 million. The GP commitment is 1.01% of aggregate commitments, contributed in cash and invested pari passu with LPs. The Fund held its first closing on April 1, 2026 with approximately $125 million in commitments against a hard cap of $200 million; final closing is expected within the next 1–2 months.

The Fund's term is 10 years from initial closing, subject to two one-year extensions at the GP's sole discretion, with any further extensions requiring LPAC consent (if formed) or a majority-in-interest of LPs. The commitment period is 5 years. Recycling of distributions is permitted up to 120% of aggregate commitments. The key person provision triggers if both Managing Partners fail to devote sufficient business time and attention to the Fund simultaneously. The Fund does not contain a no-fault divorce provision permitting LP removal of the GP absent a "cause" event, though a no-fault dissolution provision exists. Standard clawback mechanics protect LPs against excess carried interest distributions.

### Fee Structure

The management fee is 2.5% per annum on aggregate commitments through the fifth anniversary of commencement, stepping down to 1.5% per annum thereafter. The 2.5% rate is above the 2% standard observed in broader private markets, but is typical of pre-seed venture where smaller fund sizes require a higher fee load to sustain the investment team and infrastructure. A 100% management fee offset applies to any directors', consulting, monitoring, transaction, or break-up fees received from portfolio companies — the Manager represented that such fees are not received in practice.

Distributions follow an American (deal-by-deal) waterfall: return of capital to LPs first, then 20% carried interest to the GP and 80% to LPs. There is no preferred return hurdle, which is uncommon in private equity but typical in pre-seed venture capital where meaningful hurdles would rarely trigger. The clawback provision serves as the principal backstop against over-distribution of carry.

Organizational expenses are capped at $350,000 — reasonable for a fund of this size. The Fund III expense ratio for FYE December 31, 2025 was 12.23% on audited financial statements; investors should monitor the Fund IV expense ratio once audited accounts become available.

### Corporate Governance

The LPA contains an LPAC provision, but the Manager stated an LPAC will only be formed if requested by multiple larger investors. LPACs have not been established for any prior funds. Alpine would welcome the formation of an LPAC.

### Investment Strategy

Pre-seed technology at $1–3M per investment, targeting 40–50 companies via equity, SAFEs, KISS, warrants, and convertible equity. Concentration limits: 10% single company, 5% passive, 10% non-U.S./Canada. Up to 10% in digital assets permitted (not utilized to date).

### GREEN Rating Rationale

Green rating. Terms are consistent with VC market norms. The 2.5% management fee, American waterfall, and absence of a preferred return are flagged but common in the pre-seed VC space.`,

|---|---|---|---|---|

| Compliance | Annual Form ADV | Summit Advisory | Engaged (narrow) | Historical |

### Administrator — Apex Fund Services

Apex Fund Services, LLC has been engaged since Fund I. Apex uses Xero for accounting and FundPanel for LP management and reporting. Apex is notably more "hands-on" with respect to valuation than typical PE/VC administrators — proactively updating the Schedule of Investments for known events and providing valuation guidance. Engagement letter for Fund IV is expected before the first capital call. Alpine confirmed Apex's expected engagement via conference call on April 3, 2026.

### Auditor — Baker Thompson & Co. LLP

Baker, Thompson & Co. LLP is a well-known and highly-regarded auditor of VC funds in the Bay Area. Not a Big 4 or next-tier firm, but deeply experienced in the VC space. Baker Thompson also audits the prior funds and certain co-invest SPVs. Engagement expected before the first year-end audit.

### Corporate Banker — Pacific Commerce / JP Morgan

Pacific Commerce Bank collapsed in Q2 2025 and was acquired by JP Morgan. A transition plan is underway — the firm will allow its accounts to transfer when JP Morgan implements the migration. No service disruption to date. Note: Fund I utilizes Silicon Valley Bank (First Citizens Bank). Apex confirmed via the April 3, 2026 conference call that Pacific Commerce remains the operative bank account; the Fund IV account should be confirmed as fully operational under JP Morgan before the first capital call.

### Legal & Compliance

Morrison Cole Ashworth & Partners serves as fund formation counsel, continuing from prior funds. James Crawford (independent attorney, former partner at Hartwell & Sterling) acts as ad hoc deal counsel on a per-transaction basis. Summit Advisory is engaged for annual Form ADV preparation only — a narrower scope than recommended for a firm of this size.

### GREEN Rating Rationale

Green rating. The continuation of established provider relationships from prior funds provides comfort. Engagement letters are expected before the first capital call (administrator) and first year-end audit (auditor). The Pacific Commerce to JP Morgan banking transition should be monitored.`,

    name: "Investment Operations & Portfolio Controls", rating: "YELLOW",
    summary: "YELLOW: Manager does not maintain internal accounting records or track cash balances — relies entirely on Apex. No back office oversight of administrator. No formal written investment allocation policy. Cash controls via Bill.com are appropriate — dual authorization required for wires. Custom Retool deal pipeline tracking.",
    findings: `### Portfolio Management Systems

The firm uses a custom-built Retool dashboard ("People Flow") for tracking the deal pipeline and open opportunities, and an Excel dashboard for tracking key financial metrics across certain portfolio companies. The Manager expects the Fund will invest in roughly 40–50 companies.

### Investment Decision Process

All new investments require approval from both Arjun Mehta and Priya Sharma. Deal sourcing breakdown for Fund III: Founder (32%), Angel/Advisor/Scout (26%), Alpha/Founders in Residence (26%), VC referral (10%), Outbound (6%). "Alpha" refers to the firm's pre-seed program to which founders can apply.

### Investment Allocation

The firm does not have a formal written investment allocation policy separate from LPA disclosures. In practice, Fund III will be fully deployed before investing from Fund IV. Co-investments via SPVs are only offered when excess capacity exists. Alpine recommends implementing a formal allocation policy should the firm launch a new strategy or family of funds.

### Cash Tracking & Accounting

The firm does not track individual cash transactions or aggregate cash balances, relying solely on Apex to maintain and reconcile the accounting books and records using Xero. There has been no back office oversight of the Administrator's accounting work to date, though this is expected to improve with the fractional CFO (Summer 2026) and planned Head of Finance (2027).

Apex maintains formal books using Xero: daily cash posting via direct feed from Pacific Commerce, at least weekly reconciliation (more frequent near capital call dates), monthly "soft close," and quarterly "full close" producing balance sheet, schedule of investments, income statement, and statement of changes in partners' capital.

### Cash Controls

All cash movements from Pacific Commerce are effected using the bank's online banking platform, requiring one of two authorized Apex individuals to initiate wires and one Managing Partner to release. Apex completes a verification callback for new payment instructions or changes to existing instructions. Pacific Commerce also occasionally completes callbacks per its own internal policies. Operating expenses are paid via Bill.com, requiring Apex to initiate and a Managing Partner to approve. Both Managing Partners must sign on the opening of new bank accounts.

### YELLOW Rating Rationale

Yellow rating based on: (1) no internal accounting records or cash tracking by the Manager, (2) no back office oversight of the Administrator's accounting work, and (3) Excel-based portfolio management tools. Cash controls are appropriate with dual-authorization and verification callbacks.`,

    name: "Valuation, Asset Existence & Investor Reporting", rating: "YELLOW",
    summary: "YELLOW: No formal valuation committee — front office exclusively controls pricing. Distribution waterfalls maintained in Excel. No internal investor-level accounting. Mitigated by low valuation sensitivity (finite-life VC, no NAV-based capital transactions), multi-party asset verification via Apex/Baker Thompson/Carta, and no prior reporting errors.",
    findings: `### Valuation Controls

As with most closed-ended VC structures, (i) the Fund is a finite-life capital commitment vehicle with no capital transactions based on valuations, and (ii) the General Partner receives carried interest only upon a realization event. These characteristics significantly reduce valuation sensitivity and the incentive for intra-period price manipulation.

The firm has an undated valuation policy. The firm values portfolio companies at cost and marks investments up/down based on the price of a subsequent financing round with a significant new investor. If the financing round includes substantially the same investor group, the firm only marks up if fair value can be demonstrated. The Manager stated it has never marked up based on a portfolio company's performance, but does regularly mark down based on performance or macroeconomic factors.

The firm does not have a formal valuation committee. In practice, valuations are approved by the Managing Partners. On a quarterly basis, Apex prepares the Schedule of Investments, updating for known events, and provides it to the Managing Partners for adjustments and final approval. Apex noted it provides guidance on industry best practices but that valuations are ultimately the Manager's responsibility. Valuations are subject to external oversight only through the annual audit by Baker Thompson.

### Asset Existence & Verification

The Fund's investments are evidenced by private agreements maintained electronically. Share certificates for certain portfolio companies are issued via Carta. Multiple parties are involved in each transaction:

| Verification Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| Investment documentation | Apex receives all docs and wire instructions from Manager |
| Carta certificates | Apex obtains share certificates directly from Carta platform |
| Wire verification | Apex independently verifies wire details with portfolio companies before initiating |
| Audit confirmations | Baker Thompson issues confirmations to ~50% of portfolio companies annually |

### Investor Reporting

Apex will prepare and issue quarterly investor reporting within 45 business days of quarter-end via FundPanel LP Portal. Audited financial statements will be issued annually within 120 days of year-end under U.S. GAAP. The Manager approves all reporting before issuance.

Investor capital account balances are maintained by Apex using FundPanel. Distribution waterfalls are calculated using Excel, then input into FundPanel which generates per-LP distribution amounts. The Manager does not maintain internal records of investor capital account balances or waterfall calculations.

The Manager and Administrator represented that prior funds have never had an investor reporting error. The Fund's first financial reporting period is expected to end on December 31, 2026; Alpine recommends investors review the audited accounts when available.

### YELLOW Rating Rationale

Yellow rating based on: (1) no formal valuation committee, (2) front office exclusively controls pricing, (3) distribution waterfalls maintained in Excel, and (4) no internal investor-level accounting records. These concerns are partially mitigated by the closed-ended structure, carry-on-realization model, and Apex's proactive involvement in the valuation process. Alpine recommends formation of a valuation committee and incorporation of the CFO/Head of Finance into the valuation process.`,

    findings: `### Diligence Process Cooperation

The Manager was responsive and forthcoming throughout the due diligence process, providing requested documents promptly and making staff available for follow-up questions. There were no instances of evasion, delayed responses, or attempts to restrict the scope of Alpine's review.

### Administrator Cooperation

Apex was cooperative and provided independent confirmation of key operational arrangements via conference call on April 3, 2026. Apex independently verified service provider engagements, described its operational procedures in detail, and confirmed cash control and wire authorization processes without prompting from the Manager.

### Disclosure Quality

The Manager proactively disclosed areas of operational weakness, including the current lack of back office resources, the underdeveloped cybersecurity environment, and the timeline for planned improvements. This level of candor is constructive and indicates a willingness to address operational gaps.

### GREEN Rating Rationale

Green rating. No issues were noted concerning transparency. The Manager and Administrator were cooperative, responsive, and forthcoming. The Manager's proactive disclosure of operational weaknesses supports a constructive approach to remediation.`,
